You can start with try dive where you get your first breath under water. If you decided to continue, you can enroll in our Open Water Program where you learn basic skill in 3-4 pool session and study the online materials. Basically, you will learn breathing underwater, how to assemble the dive gears, equalization technique, how to move underwater like a fish and emergency procedures. 
You apply all the skill by going for 4 dives in the ocean. Usually we go for 2 days/1 night weekend trip to Pramuka island at north of Jakarta. But of course, you can select to have the dives anywhere in Indonesia :-)
